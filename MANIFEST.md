# The Lab Manifest / Discovery Index

Purpose: make The Lab repo easier for future chats to navigate without requiring exact filenames.

Use this file as the first stop when a chat needs to find relevant workflows, handoffs, decisions, tests, routing rules, naming rules, or sanitized experiment evidence.

This is a curated index, not a raw data store. Keep entries short, searchable, and sanitized.

## Start Here

1. Read `README.md` for the Lab's zones, routing stages, and logging rules.
2. Read this `MANIFEST.md` to find relevant files by topic, tool, workflow, or routing purpose.
3. Open the linked file(s) before making decisions or running a new test.
4. If a new test or decision is created, append an entry here using the maintenance template below.

## Core Routing Model

The Lab uses this lightweight flow:

1. Inbox
2. Triage
3. Evidence Pass
4. Audit
5. Route

Common route outcomes:

- Reject / Archive
- Pattern Bank
- Watchlist
- Tool Stack
- Incubator
- Existing Project Handoff
- Dedicated Experiment

## Core Zones

| Zone | Use When | Do Not Use For |
|---|---|---|
| Intake | Raw incoming items, first-pass audits, quick tool or idea triage | Heavy implementation, long experiments, mature project work |
| Incubator | Validated ideas, small experiments, tool comparisons, workflow prototypes | Raw unproven ideas, ongoing project implementation |
| Framework | Routing rules, naming rules, architecture, rubrics, thresholds, repo organization | One-off raw idea audits or tool runs unless they define a system rule |
| Archive | Prior mixed work, historical context, old decisions | Active tests unless they are only being referenced historically |

## Active Chat Map

Current active Lab chats are indexed in `framework/2026-06-15_active_lab_chat_map.md`.

Current operating layout:

| Chat | Zone | Role |
|---|---|---|
| Archive | Archive | Historical setup, mixed prior context, and setup validation |
| Intake | Intake | Raw incoming ideas, tools, posts, claims, and first-pass triage |
| LLM Council Skill Incubator | Incubator | Active lane for LLM Council / Claude Skill pressure-test experiments |
| Framework | Framework | Main system-design chat for routing, manifests, standards, and repo structure |

Concluded / handoff-complete Incubator lanes:

| Chat | Former Zone | Outcome |
|---|---|---|
| Instagram Reel Scraper Incubator | Incubator | Testing concluded; current upload path handed off to Intake. Reopen only for workflow fixes, scraper replacement tests, or major evidence-standard revisions. |
| Indeed API Incubator | Incubator | Testing concluded; adopted layered Indeed/Parse/Apify/connector tool stack handed off to Job Search. Reopen only for major Indeed, Parse, Apify, connector, pricing, endpoint, or output-shape changes. |

Update the active chat map whenever a Lab chat is created, retired, renamed, or materially changes role.

## Discovery Rules for Future Chats

When a user asks about prior Lab work:

1. Search this manifest by plain-language topic first.
2. Search for synonyms, not just exact filenames.
3. Prefer existing test files over memory when evaluating prior evidence.
4. Do not assume a missing manifest entry means no file exists; search the repo if needed.
5. If a useful file is found that is not indexed here, add it to the appropriate section.

Search cues to try:

- Tool names: `Parse`, `Apify`, `Firecrawl`, `Browserbase`, `Indeed`, `GovernmentJobs`, `Instagram`, `Airtable`, `Obsidian`, `Notion`, `Cognee`, `MemPalace`
- Workflow types: `scraper`, `job search`, `API`, `row extraction`, `market sizing`, `handoff`, `rubric`, `routing`, `Reel intake`, `evidence bundle`, `tool stack`, `memory layer`, `organization layer`, `structured tracker`, `agent memory`
- Project zones: `Intake`, `Incubator`, `Framework`, `Archive`, `Job Search`
- Outcome terms: `watchlist`, `tool stack`, `dedicated experiment`, `existing project handoff`, `pattern bank`, `closeout`

### Indeed / Job Search / Scraper Tests

| File | Stage | Summary | Verdict / Route | Search Tags |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tests/2026-05-26_parse_indeed_pipeline_assessment.md` | Evidence Pass / Audit | Parse Indeed API test covering `search_jobs` and `get_job_details`; search returned counts, related queries, pagination/context, and job keys, but not clean job-card rows. Detail endpoint returned usable records by job key. | Keep Parse as selective research probe, not primary sheet extractor. Compare against Apify/connected Indeed before adopting. | Parse, Indeed, search_jobs, get_job_details, job keys, row extraction, market sizing, detail endpoint |
| `tests/2026-05-26_parse_indeed_montana_search_and_revision_hypothesis.md` | Evidence Pass / Audit | Montana `equipment operator` search via Parse; confirmed localized result counts, job keys, pagination, related queries, and missing clean row fields. Defines `search_jobs_detailed` revision hypothesis. | Selective discovery candidate; superseded by later Parse row endpoint refinements for table-ready output. | Parse, Indeed, Montana, equipment operator, related queries, pagination, search_jobs_detailed, revision hypothesis |
| `tests/2026-05-26_apify_borderline_indeed_results_evaluation.md` | Evidence Pass / Audit | Apify `borderline/indeed-scraper` returned 20 structured job records with title, company/source, location, job URL, descriptions, dates, job type, and salary for most records. | Strong success. Original cost certainty was pending; see 2026-06-14 Apify paid export evaluation for verified pricing and export-layer routing. | Apify, borderline, Indeed scraper, clean rows, salary, apply URL, dataset, Google Sheets, job search |
| `tests/2026-06-14_apify_indeed_paid_export_layer_evaluation.md` | Incubator / Tool Stack | Apify `borderline/indeed-scraper` follow-up documenting verified `$0.005/job` pricing, 5-row/25-row/100-row runs, rich field coverage, export format guidance, and tool-stack routing. | Adopt as paid bulk export layer after connector/Parse triage; do not use for casual broad sweeps without narrowing. | Apify, Indeed, paid export, $5 per 1000 jobs, row extraction, connector comparison, Parse comparison, Google Sheets, JSON, CSV, Excel |
| `tests/2026-06-27_parse_indeed_api_incubator_closeout.md` | Incubator / Tool Stack | Closeout for the Parse / Indeed API Incubator, documenting the adopted layered Job Search tool stack. | Adopt layered stack for Job Search; close Indeed API Incubator for now. | Parse, Indeed, API, Incubator, closeout, rich_compact_v3, search_jobs_rows, Apify, connector, Job Search tool stack |

### Instagram / Reel Intake / Scraper Tests

| File | Stage | Summary | Verdict / Route | Search Tags |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| `tests/2026-06-17_instagram_reel_scraper_upload_path_closeout.md` | Incubator / Tool Stack | Closeout for the Instagram Reel scraper upload path: cheap scraper media links, local `whisper.cpp` transcription, and ZIP bundles for Intake. | Adopt as Intake upload path when a Reel scrape is justified; keep raw media/JSON out of repo. | Instagram, Reel, Reels, Apify, scraper, whisper.cpp, transcript, Raw Reels, Refined Reels, ZIP bundle, Intake evidence |

## Current Decision Index

### Parse / Indeed / Apify Job Search Tool Stack

Decision: Indeed job-search extraction should use a layered stack rather than a single source.

Adopted stack:

| Job Search Need | Preferred Source | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| Quick interactive review | ChatGPT Indeed connector | Use first when a small visible set is enough. |
| Compact scoring-ready rows | Parse `search_jobs_rows_rich_compact_v3` style endpoint | Use when row data is needed but full rich export is not justified. |
| Search-state probe / fallback | Parse marketplace search or earlier Parse row endpoints | Use when compact endpoint fails or for market-size/search-term discovery. |
| Selected detail enrichment | Parse detail endpoint | Use only for chosen high-priority jobs. |
| Paid rich export | Apify `borderline/indeed-scraper` | Use for larger/richer datasets when cost is justified. |

Rationale:

- Parse marketplace search did not originally produce clean sheet-ready rows.
- Parse detail calls require job keys and are too expensive for broad extraction if used on every result.
- Parse refined row endpoints created a useful compact-row layer for scoring/review.
- The Indeed connector is strong for interactive search/review, but exposes a limited visible result set at a time.
- Apify produced structured row-level output in one run and follow-up tests verified predictable pricing at `$0.005` per returned job (`$5 / 1,000 jobs`).
- Apify should be used as a paid rich export layer only after a lane is narrow enough to justify cost.

Use this decision when routing future Indeed scraper/API work:

- Normal job-search usage: Job Search project.
- Significant Indeed/Parse/Apify/connector/pricing/output-shape change: reopen Incubator or create a new bounded Incubator test.
- New raw claim or tool: Intake.
- General rules about when a scraper/API is good enough: Framework.

### Instagram Reel Intake Upload Path

Decision: The preferred Intake upload path for selected Instagram Reels is cheap scraper output with transcript/download toggles off, downloaded media from returned links, local `whisper.cpp large-v3-turbo` transcription, and an upload-ready ZIP bundle containing media, transcript, and matching Apify JSON export.

Rationale:

- Tested scraper media links were sufficient to download usable audio/video files.
- Paid Apify transcript and video-download toggles were not necessary by default.
- Local `whisper.cpp` transcription was competitive with the paid transcript toggle and may preserve literal phrasing better in some cases.
- The folder/script workflow produced correctly paired bulk bundles for Intake upload.
- Raw media, signed URLs, and raw JSON should remain local/uploaded to Intake as evidence, not committed to the repo.

Use this decision when routing future Instagram Reel work:

- Raw Reel with no scrape yet: Intake.
- Reel selected for evidence review: use the upload-ready ZIP workflow.
- Scraper/workflow failure or replacement comparison: Incubator.
- Stable operating rule or quick-start: Framework.
